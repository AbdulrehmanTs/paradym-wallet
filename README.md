# Paradym Wallet

This repo contains an implementation of a mobile [Paradym](https://paradym.id) SSI wallet.

## Structure

The project is a monorepo managed using **Yarn (v3)**, which contains an **Expo React Native** application. The UI is built using **Tamagui**, and navigation is handled using **Expo Router, React Navigation and Solito**. For the Agent and SSI capabilities **Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ)** is used.

The folder structure is as follows

- `apps` top level applications
  - `expo` react native app for iOS & Android
- `packages` shared packages
  - `ui` includes our custom UI kit that will be optimized by Tamagui
  - `agent` includes the Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) agent and SSI capabilities
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `navigation` This folder contains navigation-related code for RN. You may use it for any navigation code, such as custom links.

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## üèÅ Start the app

First, start by installing all dependencies by running `yarn`.

Once all dependencies are installed, you need to make sure you have a development build of the app on your mobile device.
You can install this using the following commands:

```
cd apps/expo
yarn expo prebuild
yarn ios # or android
```

You only need to install the development when **native** dependencies change. If you're only working on JS, you can skip this step if you already have the development build installed.

Once installed you can run `yarn native` from the root of the project to start your development server.

## Releasing

üöß Soon documentation will be added on how to publish a new release to the Apple App Store and Google Play Stores. üöß

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated
cd ..
yarn
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).
